# bookmark-app-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaScript Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

During this course, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I rewrote the entire app in React.
The vanilla JavaScript version: [light-dark-mode-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/light-dark-mode-v1-javascript-study).

## What it does?

This is a basic demo website. The main focus for this web page is to be able to change the screen into dark mode.

## Key features

- This is a navigation bar, and when it is clicked it smoothly scrolls to that section of the page. 
- When we click the switch, which is located in the navigation bar at the right corner, it changes from light mode to dark mode. The icon also changes from an image of a sun to a moon. The primary color also changes from orange to purple.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
